# Rollet NOÉ

NOÉ is a booking and patient management system for drive-through virology
testing, born in April 2020 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. It was first
implemented in Hungary across 2 commercially operating locations, complete with
a full fledged drive-through testing facility and operational solution. Check it
out at [www.tesztallomas.hu](https://www.tesztallomas.hu)

We stand for making testing as accessible and widespread as possible to better
understand and mitigate the epidemic. NOÉ is free to use as a backend for such
an operation by any government or organization, whether it’s free or commercial.

Features:

- Registration flow for patients
- Multi-location support
- Health survey to pre-screen for symptoms
- Operator-assigned time slots for visitors to book
- Mobile app for on-site test administration and other information access
- Django Admin based management and role handling
- Multi-product support (e.g. PCR testing and serological testing)
- Enabled for online payment and online invoicing for commercial applications
